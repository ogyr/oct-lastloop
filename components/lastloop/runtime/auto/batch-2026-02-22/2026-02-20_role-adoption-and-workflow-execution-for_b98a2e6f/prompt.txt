Run these extraction roles IN PARALLEL (they are independent):

1. /role world-effect-classifier
   Read convo.txt and:
   - Write goals.md — characterize what the user and agent were trying to achieve, how goals evolved, final state.
   - Extract all observable effects into feedbacks/ and triedbutfailed/.
   - Move user-aborted/redirected approaches to ideas/ (NOT triedbutfailed/).
   - Review for reusable workflow patterns → scaffold under agents/ if found.

2. /role feedback-loop-extractor
   Read convo.txt and extract novel tool uses into feedbacks/tools.md.

3. /role factoid-extractor
   Read convo.txt and extract non-common-knowledge factoids into factoids/systems/ and factoids/world/.

THEN after all three complete, run:

4. /role extraction-verifier
   Audit all produced files. Think → Verify against convo.txt → Fix.
   Write verification-report.md.
