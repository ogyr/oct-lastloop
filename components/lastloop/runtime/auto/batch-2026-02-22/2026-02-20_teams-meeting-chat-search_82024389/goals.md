# Goals — Teams meeting chat search

## User Goals
1. Find the meeting chat with Jürgen Gächter (future CEO of ETRON)
2. Draft and send a Letter of Intent (LOI) for Jürgen's CEO appointment to the chat

## Agent Goals
1. Locate the correct Teams chat
2. Format and send professional HTML message with LOI draft

## Goal Evolution
- **Initial request:** Find "jeurgen gaechter meeting chat" — agent found 1:1 chat instead of meeting chat
- **Clarification:** User accepted 1:1 chat when no meeting chat found
- **Expanded scope:** User added LOI drafting task with request for role-based formatting assistance
- **Final state:** LOI draft sent to 1:1 chat with Jürgen Gächter

## Final State
- ✅ Chat identified: 1:1 chat with Gaechter Juergen (ID: `19:2c532aa6-aa86-4376-be20-68831bd346e5_...`)
- ✅ LOI draft sent: Comprehensive German-language Letter of Intent covering CEO appointment terms
- ⚠️ Note: No meeting chat with Jürgen Gächter was found in recent chats
