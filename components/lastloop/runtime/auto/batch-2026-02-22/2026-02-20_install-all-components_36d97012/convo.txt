## USER [build] (claude-opus-4-6) — 2026-02-20 00:13:01

Call the `oct` tool with the user's arguments: install all

## Important concepts

- **oct** = the installer that manages tool sources and components. It lives separately from the tool repos.
- **Sources** = independent tool registries (git repos). Each source has a name (e.g., `oct-etron`, `oct-private`). Components are qualified as `source/name` (e.g., `oct-etron/glab`).
- **`update [source]`** = pull the latest version of the **tools repository** (the component catalog itself). This does NOT install or change any components in the project. Optionally filter by source name. Think of it like `apt update` — it updates the package list, not the packages.
- **`install`** = add components to this project (copy tools/commands/MCP configs into .opencode/)
- **`remove`** = remove components from this project
- **`sources`** = browse available source repos from the registry
- **`source <name> [url]`** = add a source (by registry name, or with custom url)
- **`source-remove <name>`** = remove a tool registry source
- **`docs [name]`** = start a local documentation server. With a component name, opens directly to that page.

## CLI usage

oct can also be run from the terminal (outside OpenCode) via the `oct` command:
```
oct update          # pull latest sources
oct install glab    # install a component
oct doctor          # check project health
oct sources         # browse available source repos
```
This requires the CLI wrapper installed by bootstrap (at `~/.local/bin/oct`).

## Component naming

- **Qualified names** like `oct-etron/glab` specify the source explicitly
- **Bare names** like `glab` are auto-resolved if unambiguous (only one source provides it)
- If a bare name is ambiguous (multiple sources have it), the tool will error and list the options — ask the user which source they want

## Diagnostics — install/removal logs

Every install and removal operation writes a detailed log to `.opencode/.oct/logs/<source>/<component>/`.

To read logs, call the `oct` tool with args `log <component-name>`.
NEVER read log files directly — ALWAYS use the `log` subcommand.

When ANY install or removal operation fails:
1. IMMEDIATELY call `oct` with args `log <failed-component-name>`
2. Show the full output to the user — it contains the error details, setup script stdout/stderr, and the log file path
3. This is your PRIMARY diagnostic tool. Always use it FIRST when something goes wrong.

## Behavior by subcommand

### No arguments (dashboard)
Just display the tool output. No interactivity needed. Shows sources, what's installed (with health status), what's available, and what commands exist.

### `update [source]`
Just pass through to the tool and display the result. This pulls the latest tools repo(s) — it does NOT install or modify any project components. After updating, suggest the user run `/oct` to see if new components are available.

### `install`

**If the user explicitly names components** (e.g., "install opencode-driver" or "install oct-etron/glab,oct-etron/adb"):
1. Call `oct` with args `install <the-named-components>` directly
2. Do NOT call `list` first. Do NOT ask for confirmation. Just install.
3. Display the result
4. If ANY component shows as failed, IMMEDIATELY call `oct` with args `log <component-name>` for EACH failed component and show the full output to the user

**If the user just says "install" with no specific components:**
1. Call `oct` with args `list` to get all components with install status
2. Filter to show ONLY components that are NOT yet installed
3. Present a **checkbox list** to the user (using the question tool with `multiple: true`)
4. Show source tags in the checkbox labels, e.g., "[oct-etron] glab v1.0.0 (stable)"
5. Pre-select components marked as `recommended` or `REQUIRED`
6. After the user confirms their selection, call `oct` with args `install <comma-separated-qualified-names>`
7. Display the result
8. If ANY component shows as failed, IMMEDIATELY call `oct` with args `log <component-name>` for EACH failed component and show the full output to the user

CRITICAL: NEVER present already-installed components in the install checkbox. Only show what's available to add.

### `remove`
1. Call `oct` with args `list` to get all components with install status
2. Filter to show ONLY components that ARE currently installed (marked with ✓)
3. Present a **checkbox list** to the user (using the question tool with `multiple: true`)
4. Show source tags in labels, e.g., "[oct-etron] glab v1.0.0"
5. Do NOT pre-select anything — removal must be explicit
6. After the user confirms, call `oct` with args `remove <comma-separated-qualified-names>`
7. Display the result
8. If ANY component removal shows as failed, IMMEDIATELY call `oct` with args `log <component-name>` for EACH failed component and show the full output to the user

CRITICAL: NEVER remove components without explicit user selection. NEVER auto-remove anything.

### `log <name>` — Diagnose install/removal issues
Call `oct` with args `log <component-name>`.

Returns: status (success/failed), failure reason, full log file path, and complete log output including setup script stdout/stderr.

Example: user says "oct log opencode-driver" → call `oct` with args `log opencode-driver`

IMPORTANT: This is the FIRST thing to call when anything goes wrong with an install or removal. Do not try to read log files directly.

### `docs [name]`
Pass through to the tool. Starts a local documentation server. If a component name is given, opens directly to that component's docs page. Report the URL to the user.

### `test [name]`
Run component tests to verify installations are healthy. If a component name is given, tests only that component. If no name, tests all installed components that have a `test/` directory.

Tests run automatically after every install — you do NOT need to call this explicitly unless the user asks or you want to re-verify after env changes.

Report the pass/fail summary and any failure output to the user.

### `sources`
Fetches the sources registry and lists all available source repos. Shows name, description, org, and whether already added. Suggest `/oct source <name>` to add one.

### `source <name> [url]`
Add a source. If only a name is given, looks it up in the registry. If name + url, adds a custom source. After success, suggest running `/oct` to see available components from the new source.

### `source-remove <name>`
Pass through to the tool. If the source has installed components, the tool will list them and warn. The agent should ask the user for confirmation before proceeding.

### `pin <source> <hash|latest>`
Pass through. Note: requires a source name as the first argument.

### `doctor`
Run health checks on all installed components. Pass through to the tool and display the result. If issues are found, suggest fixes:
- **Missing file**: suggest `install <component>` to reinstall
- **Missing MCP config**: suggest `install <component>` to reinstall
- **Missing env var**: show the env var name, description, and where to set it (e.g., `.env.local`)
- **Failed last install**: suggest `log <component>` for details, then `install <component>` to retry

### `outdated`
Compare installed component versions against what's available in the cached source repos. Pass through to the tool and display the result.
- Default: compares against the local cache (fast, no network)
- With `--remote`: fetches latest from remote repos first (slower, but shows true latest)
If components are outdated, suggest `update` to refresh the catalog, then `install <component>` to reinstall with the latest version.

### All other subcommands (list, status, help, init)
Just pass through to the tool and display the result. No interactivity needed.
